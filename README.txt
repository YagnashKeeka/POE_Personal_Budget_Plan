* 1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The budget planning application is now presented throught an interface. The user would have the
ability to plan their budget. Their Salary and monthly expenses would be inputted by the user.
The user can choose whether they are renting a property or would like to buy a property. They
can also choose to enter values into details of the vehicle they would like to purchase, or may
leave it blank. The user would have an option to choose whether they would like to save a specific
amount for a specific period with the interest rate that stated. There are three buttons availible
for the user. First one is Validate Expense. The user can choose this to understand if they have 
budgeted their expense correctly. The second button is List of expenses, where user cann choose to 
view all of their expenses made. The third buttonne is estimated savings value, where the user can
determine how money they would need to save each month to save up for a specific goal.

* 2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION (LECTURERS FEEDBACK)
The main thing that I changed was the list, where I changed it to show that the the list of 
expenses would display each amount as well as for the name of the expense made. For example,
it would display; 750 -> Tax . The way the delegate was called had to be changed as it was not 
receiving any response. What has been done? Created a delegate that is declared as a string, then,
created a method to return an error message. In a button, a string variabe has been created which 
equals to null. Through the instantiation of the delegate, the message was called through the variable
that was created
